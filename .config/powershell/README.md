# Powershell

There are two entirely different versions of Powershell at play here, 5.1 (default and built into Windows), and 7.X.X (way more sensible and up-to-date).

The config files here should be symlinked to the right spot(s) to be used by each of these versions of Powershell, so updates here should be immediately available.
