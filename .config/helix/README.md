# HELIX - A neat text editor

[https://helix-editor.com/](https://helix-editor.com/)

Helix is a neat vim-like editor that runs in the terminal. If you are new to vim and similar editors, I recommend giving Helix a try! It has a much easier setup experience, and has fewer features to learn. That means it's less customizable and powerful, but there's already a lot to learn here.
