# WEZTERM - A pretty cool terminal emulator

[https://wezfurlong.org/wezterm/](https://wezfurlong.org/wezterm/)

I like WezTerm for a number of reasons:
- It's cross-platform (I need Windows for work & use Linux at home)
- Native multiplexing/splitscreen (tmux is hard to set up on Windows)
- Lua config is much better than the Windows alternatives
- It's fast
- Built-in NerdFonts
- Cool transparency effects that don't make the text transparent

A lot of these are responses to issues I've had with Cmder, but it's also just an all-around good terminal.
