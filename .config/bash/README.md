# Bash - The Bourne Again Shell

Hopefully you know what bash is. It's my shell of choice for a couple reasons:
- It's easily available on Windows via Git
- There's tons of info about it online
- I know how it works

I keep all my bash config here, even though bash can't load files from ~/.config by default. I just load it all as needed from ~/.bashrc
